# lessonLMS - A Custom WordPress LMS Theme

**lessonLMS** is a custom-built, lightweight WordPress theme that transforms your site into a personal Learning Management System (LMS). It is not dependent on heavy third-party plugins; instead, it leverages core WordPress functions (like Custom Post Types, Meta Boxes, and the Customizer API) to ensure maximum performance and flexibility.

This project serves as a perfect example of advanced WordPress theme development concepts, including AJAX, custom data handling, and building interactive admin widgets.

## ✨ Key Features

This theme is packed with custom-coded features required for a modern LMS:

- **"Course" Custom Post Type:** A dedicated `course` post type allows for easy creation and management of courses directly from the admin dashboard.
    
- **Custom Meta Boxes:** Each course includes a comprehensive meta box to store details like Price, Original Price, Video Hours, Article Count, Language, Subtitles, and lists for "What You'll Learn," "Requirements," and "Target Audience."
    
- **AJAX-Based Enrollment:** Users can enroll in courses with a single click, without a page reload. This is powered by the WordPress AJAX API (`wp_ajax_`).
    
- **Custom Review System:** Students can submit ratings and reviews for courses. The theme automatically calculates and displays the average rating and total review count.
    
- **Full Theme Customizer Support:** The `WP_Customize_API` is used extensively, allowing admins to edit most sections of the theme (Hero, Features, CTA, Blog, Footer) directly from the live customizer.
    
- **Admin Dashboard Widget:** A custom dashboard widget shows "at-a-glance" enrollment statistics, including total enrollments and a list of the most recent student sign-ups.
    
- **Modular File Structure:** The theme's frontend sections (e.g., `hero.php`, `features.php`) are neatly organized in a `sections/` folder for clean and maintainable code.
    
- **Custom Menus & Sidebars:** Registered multiple menu locations (Primary, Mobile, Footer) and a dedicated "Blog Sidebar" widget area.

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the `lessonLMS` theme on your WordPress installation:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/nayemspecial/lessonLMS.git
    ```
    
2. Upload Theme:
    
    Upload the entire lessonLMS folder to your WordPress installation's wp-content/themes/ directory.
    
3. Activate Theme:

    - Go to `Appearance > Customize` to update the Hero, Footer, and other sections.
        
    - Go to `Appearance > Widgets` to populate your Blog Sidebar.
        
    - Start adding new courses from the `Courses > Add New Course` menu in your dashboard.
